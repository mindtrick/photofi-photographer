zz_SIGN+ZIPALIGN

You must have Java Development Kit installed, with the jarsigner tool. 
You must also have a .keystore key which is working with jarsigner.

Place your key.keystore in this folder, with the unsigned.apk

Remember the JDK Path, as you will need this. It is usually C:/Program Files/Java/JDKx/bin (x referring to the version number)

Run zz_SIGN+ZIPALIGN.bat, with administration rights. 

Follow the on-screen instructions, and hopefully there are no errors.

This is a very basic script, and it will carry on if there is an error (i,e, signing the app, will carry onto to zipalign, even if the signing failed.)
So please exit the cmd, or carry on if you want.

FOR zz_SIGN+ZIPALIGN_FOR_APP - To make the signing procedure more permanent.

edit the zz_SIGN+ZIPALIGN_FOR_APP.bat script with a good text editor (I use Notepad++)

replace all WRITE_PATH_TO_JARSIGNER with the path to the jarsigner. It is usually C:/Program Files/Java/JDKx/bin (x referring to the version number)

replace all UNSIGNED_APP_NAME.apk with the unsigned app name (For me this would be unsignedBluFrost.apk)

replace all KEYSTORE_NAME with the keystore name that you have created.

replace the ALIAS_NAME with the alias_name used when creating your certificate.

replace the APP_NAME with the desired name for the finished app. (For me this would be BluFrost.apk)
